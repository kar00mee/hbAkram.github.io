	<p>The webinar will review the use of head mounted near-to-eye displays and their use in wet, dusty, loud, hazardous industrial environments.<br><br> These new technologies help more effective collaboration between workers in the field and others in control rooms, remote operating centres, suppliers or consultants.<br><br> This improved collaboration reduces cost and enables faster response to operating issues.
	This is aimed at operating companies and those providing onsite inspections in ATEX areas. Benefits of the technology can be to allow a single worker on site to communicate over Microsoft teams to other workers or specialists who are based in control rooms or located remotely and allow collaborative working.</p>
